Nepal,Heading towards nepal to make a Great nepal,"Hello, everyone! I just wanted to share something exciting with you. My friend and I have been living in Australia for the past three years, and we've been constantly dreaming of doing something impactful in Nepal. We‚Äôve seen that the Nepalese market has so much potential but needs some changes to really thrive. We've come up with ideas that could help support and grow new startups in Nepal, making it easier for entrepreneurs to get started.

Watching shows like Shark Tank India has made us wonder why these kinds of opportunities and investor support aren‚Äôt more common in Nepal. We believe people in Nepal have amazing ideas, but they lack access to investors and government support. Our goal is to solve these issues and create a better environment for startups.

In just three years, we‚Äôll be heading back to Nepal, ready to make a difference and work towards a brighter future for our country. Let‚Äôs create a great Nepal together!",0.91,48,0,48,16,"Two of the most important thing our Nepal need to have is

Nepal,Why Do Most Startups and Restaurants Struggle to Succeed in Nepal?,"
One of the main reasons many startups, restaurants, and other businesses struggle in Nepal is the lack of consistent customer service and hygiene. In other countries like Australia, businesses pay a lot of attention to these areas. For instance, many Nepali restaurants in Australia maintain high standards of cleanliness and customer service to stay competitive.

In Nepal, there is a growing need for homegrown brands that focus on quality and service. For example, we could benefit from establishing more hygiene-focused juice companies, as there‚Äôs a lack of options for safe and clean beverages. Instead of relying on international ride-sharing apps, Nepal could also develop its own app with better customer service and local understanding.

I believe that if Nepali businesses focus on these areas‚Äîconsistent customer service, quality, and hygiene‚Äîthey can build stronger, longer-lasting brands and foster more trust among customers. There‚Äôs potential to make a big impact by adopting these strategies.",0.81,22,0,22,29,"50% of businesses fail in the first 5 years, in the west not just nepal. Nepal is an over saturated market, if you aren't the best or doing something new, things like restaurants will struggle to stay afloat. Drawing example to Australia is pointless, they have to adhere to those standards because of the strict regulations which costs money, otherwise everyone there would cut all the corners to save money as well. 

Australians use uber which an American app or didi a Chinese app, every country relies on other countries, thats not exclusive to nepal just because we use the Bangladeshi pathao. | I know its a little off topic, but boy I see too many restaurants opening in ktm and somehow they are getting away with it. There are now pretty many and well invested restaurants even in areas that are very residential. They have even sustained themselves and its crazy to see this trend rising even more. | ""For instance, many Nepali restaurants in Australia maintain high standards of cleanliness and customer service to stay competitive.""

And still they goes down. Restaurants business struggles everywhere and not just in Nepal. Though I fully agree on restaurant not focusing on hygiene here. One example of business going down because of this could be Burger House. Very popular local restaurant chain. Initially they were good but slowly they sucked in every branch. I guess they had to close the Thamel branch as well.

If any business can 1. Serve good food 2. Can provide better service 3. Focus on hygiene then in Nepal it is much easier to establish the business. One example to this is Himalayan Java.

Regarding the Startup in general, I guess it is somewhat related to Customer service, lacks product sense and quality, and perhaps low demand as well as Nepal has small market and once another competitor joins in you both struggle to make money. | 1. Lack of quality of consistent food.

2. Lack of quality of customer service. 

3. Market saturation. 

4. Lack of creativity, almost same menu eveywhere. 

5. Inconsistent price of supplies required.

6. Greed of owner. (Not paying the suppliers and sending bouncing cheques which hurts the image of the restaurants within supplier chain businesses) 

7. Higher taxes.

8. Lack of finanical support/relief packages from govt.

9. Hard to sustain in current economic trend.

10. Overworking the staff and not paying them on time.

Praye restaurant, customer retention ko lagi brainstorm pani gardaina. Khana ko consistent quality pani hudaina. Time ma khayera niskina pani paidaina. Food safety ko topic ma ta jadai najam, you might get sick after eating in some restaurants daily. Tara coffee ko price 350 huncha with service charge. It might be cheaper and healthier to hire a cook for yourself.

Nepal,Im launching affordable cosmetic brand in Nepal.,"Skincare should be part of a basic routine, but it is so expensive to afford any good brands.

We‚Äôve worked in China and the products are almost ready, down to packaging. I know people would rebuff if we say it‚Äôs made in China but it is what it is. (The production team works with some high quality brands as well)

I understand that it‚Äôs not gonna be a success and generate huge profit as the market is really small.

If you want a good price one then I recommend Lotus Adventure one (1*2 Sofa Seat one), you need to pay 1600 for that and they have comfy and cozy seats with blankets. (Water too)

If you want in decent price then go for M&S adventure one (2*2 Sofa Seat one), you need to pay 1200 for that, seats are comfy and cozy and they also give a blanket.

ASAPPP | Few observations and suggestions:

* It's too much of a coincidence that things got stolen at exact time you went to kitchen withing such short span of time. Who is the guy that opens the door of the house and comes outside moments before the thief enters? I noticed that he turns back towards the main gate couple of times as if he is looking for someone. Mighty sus, could be an accomplice.
* Who is this dai that went to turn on the motor? Motor turn on garna tyati herai time ta lagdaina, another sus.
* If he is a professional thief who has done it a lot of time then he will break you macbook and sell the parts...selling the whole macbook is very risky. But still, keep an eye out on Hamrobazar an FB marketplace for cheap listing of macbook airs.
* That must be an electric guitar and by the looks of the bag, not a cheap one. There's no point of selling guitars for parts (unless just selling the pickups)...so he'll have to sell the whole thing. Keep an eye out for the guitar as well, in hamrobazar and FB marketplace. If possible, comment the brand and model of the guitar here and a lot of us could that for you.
* The guy is clearly identifiable from his attire and our streets are heavily surveilled by CCTV cams. And you are in luck as it is a festival season...very less people movement and traffic is scarce. Police can track that guy's movement even more easily. Ghar sammai bhetauna sakchha. Try to force them to investigate more seriously. Source-force laauna milchha bhaney lagau...don't let them neglect it. Night time ko grainy CCTV footage bata movement track garera killer patta lagayeko ta chha...yo ta ekdum sajilo ho in comparison. I think cops lurk in this sub as well, help the guy out if you are reading this.

Share longer clips from the CCTVs of the hostel, at least from an hour before the theft to an hour after the discovery of theft. Might help to observe things that might have been missed so far. All the best. | https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UUbOzlLPRJwkuhj9BRLJp94DOhhAgMpK

I think you should focus on a career where your foundation is strong. If you have completed a bachelor's in physics and still have an interest in it, pursue a path in physics.

If you can't find any job, consider teaching. You can save money for a master‚Äôs degree this way. Physics is challenging, and you're already in this field. You can help others. I‚Äôm not sure if teaching is what you want, but it‚Äôs a fast way to secure a job.

Nepal, Consumer Rights in Reality ‚Äì Are We Really Protected,"
I've noticed several examples where we, as consumers, seem to be getting deceived by shopkeepers and local businesses. Here are a few of my recent experiences:

1. Warranty Issues with Products CG LED bulbs are sold with a 24-month warranty clearly written on the packaging. However, when I asked about it, the shopkeeper told me that they only honor a 1-year warranty. He even claimed that no one provides a 2-year warranty, and it‚Äôs ‚Äújust written there.‚Äù It‚Äôs confusing and misleading when businesses don‚Äôt honor the warranties they advertise.

2. Monopoly in School Supplies During Baishakh, when schools and colleges open, stationery shops in my town come together to create a monopoly on textbooks and other supplies. They refuse to offer any discounts or allow bargaining, they create  only one place in town to buy these items. This makes it very hard for families, especially those on tight budgets, to afford necessary materials.

3. Pushing Products for Profit Whenever I go to buy household items like soap or washing powder, shopkeepers often try to push products with higher profit margins. They don‚Äôt even ask if I have a preferred brand; they simply push what benefits them most. It feels like my choice as a consumer isn‚Äôt respected at all.

These are just a few examples of how shopkeepers and businesses seem to take advantage of regular customers. We‚Äôre taught about consumer rights in school, but I‚Äôm starting to feel like they don‚Äôt exist in practice. Who can we turn to for help, and how can we make sure our rights are respected?

Has anyone else experienced similar issues? I‚Äôd love to hear your stories.

Enjoy your time in Nepal without trepidations | Nah, Nepalese won't hate Indians for no reason. The only reason there's a tension between these two countries is because of everything related to India, let me give you a common man's perspective particularly the recent developments: 

1. Our current PM Oli is basically useless even for us, but that doesn't mean we enjoy Indian media running lowest level of propaganda like Oli X Chinese Embassador.

2. How almost every common Indian thinks Nepal was a part of India, which has everything to do with again your media and teachings, there are even film directors casually saying this. 

3. Our Sovereignty is too sensitive to us, which is why we don't tolerate anything related to this.

4. The Border encroachment is a normal thing, we grew up hearing and facing this, and almost every Indians don't know about it. Our people of Terai/Southern regions know this pain really well. 

5. Lastly, the economic blockage which destroyed the already severed trust.

Now, every other reasons are beyond common/normal person, and they're more on the people who like to read stuffs, so let me not present them. 

Regarding if Nepalese would hate you, well in any of the reason about you don't see the Indian people as the cause, so you won't be hated.

I was shopping For flowers with my mom today morning, mom told to take out 'one jhuppa flowers' from the hook and immediately thought other jhuppa was nice, so she asked the woman to take out another ( we were buying two jhuppa) , now she started abusing saying kina nikalna lako, aba yo 1000 ko ni 1200 dinu and blah blah with very rude tone , i talked with mom 'kasto ho bolne somat ni navako' and now she started abusing me saying 'this and that' infront of my mother , the crowd was huge .. i also confronted 'yetro samaj sakshi cha euta bolne somat chaina' we didnt buy any flowers from there...and now this incident is stuck in my head..what to do ?

Nepal,To the son/husband living in an arranged family.,"In joint family, how often do you get in a problem regarding this sasu buhari ko kach-kach ? They have not involved in this direct fight but both my mother and wife keep my ear filled with each other‚Äôs issues. And I can take none of the side.

Keep the peace. Your wife is the one having to live in your house with your parents so give her grace. Side with her when you can, because she has no one but you on her side in that house. Try to get your parents to see things from her perspective as well. It‚Äôs not easy having to live with your in-laws all day every day for the foreseeable future! | Nepali parents ra chora chori to problem nai yei ho. 

Why don't we normalise living seperate rather living together and trying to save money? 

Most buhari i talk to are ready to apply foreign studies so they don't have to live with their in laws. 

Parents le ni bujna khojdainan. 

We should normalise living seperately after marriage. Get an apartment | >Malai ta yo 2 side balance garna last garho lagcha. Tapai haru ko pani kura sunam na.

Move out.. get a separate place with your wife... she did the same. | The truth is now you have a new family and soon you will have kids if you guys want to. When you make it obvious to your parents that you are now an independent person with a new family unit to look after, they will back off.
