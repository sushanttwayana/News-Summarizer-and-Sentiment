# Gender-and-Age-Detection
Detect gender and age from images. Use CNN, test with accuracy, and display terminal output for detection results and accuracy.

For this project I have used two different datasets and created two different project. In the first project as per the available dataset only the range of the age wala classified into three different categories namely
Class
MIDDLE    10804
YOUNG      6706
OLD        2396

for this project we have used **PRETRAINED MODEL XCEPTION**, but the problem with this dataset is that only the age range is classified with the help of a csv file. For the gender category this dataset is not enough that's why I have switcched to next dataset for second project

This is the output as per predicted and generated by the first project:

*The 2nd Project uses the Utkface-new dataset and this is used to detect age and gender.*

This dataset I have downloaded is composed of 23,708 images with age and gender in the Image Name. For Example, 1_0_0239389.JPG image means that age is 1, gender is 0 (male) and 0 refers to the race (not needed in this task). So I split the image name on ' ' so I can get separated age and gender with image.
