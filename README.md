# Gender-and-Age-Detection
Detect gender and age from images. Use CNN, test with accuracy, and display terminal output for detection results and accuracy.

For this project I have used two different datasets and created two different project. In the first project as per the available dataset only the range of the age wala classified into three different categories namely
Class
MIDDLE    10804
YOUNG      6706
OLD        2396

for this project we have used **PRETRAINED MODEL XCEPTION**, but the problem with this dataset is that only the age range is classified with the help of a csv file. For the gender category this dataset is not enough that's why I have switcched to next dataset for second project
